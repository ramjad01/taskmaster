# ✅ TaskMaster - A Simple To-Do App

This is a small project I built to practice my JavaScript skills and to have something practical that I can actually use.
  
It’s a lightweight to-do list app that runs directly in the browser. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when you’re done. Everything is saved in your browser’s local storage so your list stays even if you refresh or close the tab.  

I decided to make this because I wanted a clean and minimal example of a web app built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no heavy setup, just the essentials. It also gave me the chance to organize my code into multiple files and think about how the pieces fit together.

## ✨ Features

- Add new tasks with a click or by pressing Enter  
- Mark tasks as complete (they’ll get crossed out)  
- Delete tasks you don’t need anymore  
- Tasks are saved automatically in localStorage

## 🚀 How to Run It

Option 1: Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/todo-app.git

2. Open the todo-app folder.

3. Double-click index.html -> it will open in your browser!

Option 2: Run Online (GitHub Pages)

I also deployed this using GitHub Pages so you can try it directly in your browser without downloading anything:

## 📖 Why I Built This

I wanted a project that was small enough to build quickly but still meaningful enough to show how I write code. This app touches on user interaction, persistence, and clean separation of HTML/CSS/JS. It’s not over-engineered, but it solves a real problem in a simple way.

## 🔧 Possible Improvements

If I had more time, I’d love to expand this with:

⦁	Due dates for tasks

⦁	Categories or tags

⦁	A search or filter feature

⦁	Syncing with a backend so tasks could be shared across devices

Thanks for checking this out!
